  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites that starts with a strong
    reliable foundation with clean HTML content that works for every user no matter what
    device or browser they have. Once the basic structure is in place developers
    layer on optional enhancements like CSS for design and JavaScript for
    interactivity only if the users browser supports them. This ensures that the
    important information is always available even if advanced features dont load. Using this method made it much easier to be able to build my final project.

  <p>
    This thought process is important in modern web development because the web is used on
    many devices like new smartphones and old computers with weak
    connections. Progressive enhancement guarantees accessibility with faster load times
    and a more dependable user experience. It also makes websites more maintainable
    because content and design and behavior are separated instead of being tangled
    together.
