  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites that starts with a strong,
    reliable foundation: clean HTML content that works for every user, no matter what
    device or browser they have. Once the basic structure is in place, developers
    layer on optional enhancements—like CSS for design and JavaScript for
    interactivity—only if the user’s browser supports them. This ensures that the
    essential information is always available, even if advanced features do not load.

  <p>
    This approach is important in modern web development because the web is used on
    many kinds of devices, from new smartphones to old computers with weak
    connections. Progressive enhancement guarantees accessibility, faster load times,
    and a more dependable user experience. It also makes websites more maintainable
    because content, design, and behavior are separated instead of being tangled
    together.
