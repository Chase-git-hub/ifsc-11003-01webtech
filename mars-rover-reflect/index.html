  <h2>Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Developing this Mars Rover website project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end web development and the importance of accessibility and structure in modern design. My goal was to create a clean, informative, and visually appealing site that highlights NASA’s Mars Rover Program and its incredible technological achievements.

    During revision, I focused on improving both usability and presentation. I reorganized my HTML structure to use proper semantic elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to make the site more accessible for screen readers. I also optimized my images by resizing and balancing their width and height to maintain a better visual layout across different screen sizes.

    Adding a dark-mode toggle was one of my favorite improvements, allowing users to switch themes for better comfort and readability. I also replaced the old email link with a real contact form so visitors can submit messages directly through the website. This change not only improved functionality but also gave the site a more professional, user-focused design.

    Overall, this project taught me how small details—like consistent navigation, color contrast, descriptive alt text, and clean CSS—can make a big difference in user experience. I learned how to apply technical and creative skills together to present accurate, educational information in a way that’s both engaging and accessible to all audiences.
